    "section": "",
    "text": "On Wednesday the 7th of August at 3pm UK time, Dr Kaitlyn Johnson will discuss the challenges and opportunities in developing models and software tools that incorporate data on viral concentrations in wastewater to forecast hospital admissions in the US.\nWhile wastewater-based epidemiology presents a tremendous opportunity for passive, population-level infectious disease surveillance, the complexity of the wastewater data generating process and its relation with tradition epidemiological indicators makes integration into real-time infectious disease modeling frameworks challenging. In this talk, we present a model that jointly infers latent infection dynamics from wastewater data from multiple subpopulations and hospital admissions from a global population, in this case from individual US states. Building off of the semi-mechanistic renewal approach in EpiNow2, we add a wastewater data generating component and estimate the effective reproductive number at the global and local level using a hierarchical partial pooling model. We describe preliminary results evaluating the forecast performance of the model both retrospectively and in real-time. Lastly, we will describe the challenges and tradeoffs between developing pipelines for production for a specific problem versus developing generalizable tooling, specifically in the field of wastewater-based epidemiology where data structures and systems vary greatly.\nKaitlyn Johnson is currently a data scientist at the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics at the US CDC. Prior to joining CDC, Kaitlyn worked as a data analyst at the Rockefeller Foundation, where she mainly focused on developing publicly available decision-support tools to estimate SARS-CoV-2 variant prevalence dynamics globally. Prior to joining Rockefeller, she worked as a post-doc at the UT COVID-19 Modeling Consortium led by Lauren Meyers at UT Austin. Here she worked closely with the university and the city of Austin to provide model-based analyses to inform COVID-19 policies and resource allocation. Her broader interests include: real-time outbreak analysis, open source tool development, wastewater-based epidemiology, partial pooling/hierarchical modeling, integration of complex and disparate data sources.\nA recording of this talk will be posted to our YouTube channel and asynchronous discussion will be possible on our community site. You can also ask questions ahead of time and asynchronously there."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On Wednesday October 1st, Sandra Montes will discuss optimisation and dynamic survival analysis approaches for epidemic preparedness.\nMathematical models play a central role in understanding infectious disease transmission and guiding interventions. However, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant limitations: models were often slow to adapt, labour-intensive to extend, and difficult to optimise for policy use. Our research aims to build a toolkit of model components that supports the rapid development of complex epidemiological models, combining mechanistic structure with optimisation and statistical inference to produce models that are both broad (across multiple diseases) and deep (capturing heterogeneities).\nAs an initial step towards this goal, we explored the feasibility and robustness of automated optimal control methods. We frame outbreak management as an optimal control problem, where interventions are treated as decision variables. By discretising epidemic dynamics in time, we reformulate the problem as a nonlinear programming task that can be solved in the Julia ecosystem, particularly using JuMP.jl optimisation package. Through case studies, we assessed the effort needed to adapt compartmental models, the time required to obtain solutions, and the performance of both open-source and licensed solvers.\nMoreover, we are developing a discrete-time formulation of Dynamic Survival Analysis (DSA) to link deterministic epidemic models with line-list data. By treating infection and recovery as survival processes, discrete DSA aligns with daily surveillance data and enables Bayesian inference using the Turing.jl package. We are currently testing its ability to recover key parameters under different infectious period assumptions, comparing a PDE-based model with its Boxcar counterpart.\nTogether, this work illustrates our progress toward a toolkit that integrates data, models, and optimisation, aiming for faster, broader, and more reproducible epidemic modelling to support transparent and actionable decision-making in future outbreaks.\nSandra is a Research Fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, working on the UKRI-funded project: “Building an epidemiological modelling toolkit for epidemic preparedness”. She has a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering and completed her PhD in Engineering Mathematics at the University of Bristol in 2023. She has developed a range of mathematical and computational models for biological systems, including synthetic gene regulation networks, organoid morphology, and population network dynamics for sexually transmitted infections.\nA recording of this talk will be posted to our YouTube channel and asynchronous discussion will be possible on our community site.

    "text": "On Wednesday the 8th of January at 3pm UK time, Dr Spencer Fox will discuss ensemble models for infectious diseases and microHubs.\nOn the basis of historical influenza and COVID-19 forecasts, we found that more than 3 forecast models are needed to ensure robust ensemble accuracy. Additional models can improve ensemble performance, but with diminishing accuracy returns. This understanding will assist with the design of current and future collaborative infectious disease forecasting efforts. Building on this work, we are pioneering the use of “microHubs” that mimic larger collaborative forecast hubs using a minimal subset of robust forecasting models, dramatically lowering the required resources for forecasting and allowing for organizations to mirror hubs using privately held data. I will discuss our pilot project from the past year for influenza, COVID-19, and RSV healthcare forecasts for the Paraguay Ministerio de Salud Pública y Bienestar Social in collaboration with the CDC, Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the Pan American Health Organization.\nSpencer J.

    "section": "",
    "text": "On Wednesday the 7th of May at 3pm UK time, Dongxuan Chen will talk about her work on COVID-19.\nThis seminar consists of two parts, the first part will show how to obtain temporal estimates of the generation interval at population level, the second part will show how realized generation interval and superspreading potential might differ across settings. First, as Park et al (Park et al., 2021 PNAS) illustrated that sampling direction bias during an ongoing epidemic would cause systematic bias in the forward serial interval, it is not recommended to directly use the serial interval as a proxy for the generation interval, especially for temporal estimates. Therefore, Chen et al (Chen et al., 2022 Nat Commun) developed an inferential framework based on Park et al’s theory to obtain the time-varying forward generation interval that corrects for the sampling direction bias, from contact tracing data with both symptom onset and exposure window available. Second, a detailed investigation was conducted to examine the potential differences in realized generation interval and superspreading potential (as measured by the degree of overdispersion in cluster size distribution) in various transmission settings in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic before the Omicron wave. As contact tracing for clustered transmission events cannot clearly indicate the individual-level transmission chains, a mixture model was used to infer the generation interval, and a negative binomial model that considered underreporting scenario was used to estimate the mean and degree of overdispersion of the cluster size distribution. Furthermore, this study explored how different stringency of the control measures could have impact on the realized generation interval and final cluster size observed.\nDr. Dongxuan Chen obtained her PhD degree in infectious disease modelling from the University of Hong Kong, with thesis entitled “Investigating changes in COVID-19 epidemiological parameters from different perspectives” supervised by Prof. Ben Cowling. Before joining HKU, she completed her master’s degree in statistical science for the life and behavioral sciences from Leiden University, the Netherlands. She did her master’s internship at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in early 2020, supervised by Prof. Jacco Wallinga, and contributed to some of the early COVID-19 studies.\nA recording of this talk will be posted to our YouTube channel and asynchronous discussion will be possible on our community site.

    "section": "",
    "text": "On Wednesday the 5th of March at 3pm UK time, Oswaldo Gressani will discuss the EpiLPS ecosystem.\nRecent epidemics have underlined the crucial role of statistical modeling. Statistical models form the core backbone that is used to compute estimates of key epidemiological quantities from infectious disease data. Having statistical methods that deliver state-of-the art analytical tools is not only important for understanding the transmission dynamics of a pathogen, but also for orienting effective public health strategies to mitigate disease spreading and hence for future pandemic preparedness. Laplacian-P-splines (LPS) provide a fast and flexible Bayesian inference methodology anchored around Laplace approximations and P-splines. The LPS methodology has recently been extended to infectious disease models in the EpiLPS ecosystem (https://epilps.com/) for estimation of various epidemic metrics such as the time-varying reproduction number, the incubation period and also for nowcasting. In this seminar, Dr. Gressani will highlight the role of P-splines for modeling smooth epidemic model components and illustrate the capability of EpiLPS to carry out inference through a completely sampling-free scheme that involves a negligible computational cost as compared to classic Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Moreover, he will emphasize how the associated R package can be used for analysis of real epidemic data. Finally, he will discuss current and future extensions of the EpiLPS toolbox.\nDr. Gressani is currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Data Science Institute (DSI) at Hasselt University in Belgium. His work focuses on extensions of EpiLPS to other key epidemiological characteristics and in particular to epidemiological delay distributions. He recently obtained a FWO (Fonds Wetenschappelijk onderzoek) outgoing mobility grant for a short research stay at Hong Kong University to work on EpiLPS extensions and related topics. Previously, he obtained his PhD in Statistics in 2020 from the University of Louvain under the supervision of Prof. Philippe Lamber. Apart from EpiLPS, Dr. Gressani has research interests in computational methods in statistics and theoretical contributions to Bayesian methods. He loves coding in general (R, C++, html, Markdown) and developed several R projects/packages which are available on his personal webpage (https://greoswa.com/CV.html).\nA recording of this talk will be posted to our YouTube channel and asynchronous discussion will be possible on our community site.

In March of 2024, Puerto Rico declared a public health emergency due to escalating dengue activity. This then prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to activate a dengue emergency response and issue a Health Alert Network advisory. As the modeling task force for the CDC’s 2024-2025 Dengue Response, Maile’s team developed and deployed a suite of real-time modeling tools to support public health decision-making throughout the epidemic in Puerto Rico. These modeling tools included dengue epidemic alert thresholds, nowcasting, time-varying reproductive number estimation, and hospital capacity models. These tools were regularly updated and disseminated to partners to inform situational awareness. This presentation will highlight the role of modeling during the dengue response in Puerto Rico, key methodological approaches used, and lessons learned for future outbreak preparedness and response.\nMaile B. Thayer, PhD, MS is the Team Lead for the Epidemic Analytics Team at the Dengue Branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her work at the Dengue Branch focuses on developing and evaluating mathematical and statistical models to improve surveillance, early warning, prevention, and control of arboviral diseases and to identify and characterize underlying drivers of arboviral disease epidemics and spread. Prior to the CDC, Maile earned her Masters in Biostatistics at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in 2017 and her PhD in Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases at Yale University in 2021. Some of her previous research focused on mathematical models for typhoid and other diseases, characterizing disease dynamics and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of interventions.\nA recording of this talk will be posted to our YouTube channel and asynchronous discussion will be possible on our community site.

    "section": "",
    "text": "On Wednesday the 4th of September at 3pm UK time, Dr Kris Parag will discuss how feedback control theory can improve both the understanding and suppression of epidemics in real time.\nReproduction numbers, which define the magnitude at which infections multiply, are conventionally used to assess how difficult it is to control an infectious disease. By reframing the multiplicative process of transmission as a positive feedback loop, Dr. Parag will demonstrate that this approach is idealistic and propose two new controllability margins that better reflect the effort needed to control an epidemic. The second part of the talk will be about interventions. Deciding when to impose or relax a non-pharmaceutical intervention is an enduring problem that is aggravated by the limitations and uncertainties innate to practical surveillance data. By recognising the negative feedback loop between a chosen intervention and future (noisy) disease dynamics, Dr. Parag will present an optimal control algorithm to balance the risks of inaction with the costs of intervention.\nDr. Parag is an advanced research fellow at Imperial College London and honorary lecturer at the University of Bristol. He leads the EpiEng group, which aims to improve understanding of Epidemiological processes by adapting concepts from Engineering disciplines. This merges his training in control (PhD, Cambridge) and aerospace (MEng, Sheffield) engineering with his experience across phylodynamics (postdoc, Oxford) and epidemiology (research fellow, Imperial). The current goal of his group is to leverage feedback control methodology to design more effective real-time strategies for outbreak surveillance and suppression.\nTo read more about his work, see this paper and this preprint.\nA recording of this talk will be posted to our YouTube channel and asynchronous discussion will be possible on our community site.

    "section": "",
    "text": "On Wednesday the 6th of November at 3pm UK time, Dr Matthew Shin will discuss quantifying regularity of COVID-19 epidemic waves in France to assess predictability of future waves and improve forecasting.\nForecasting healthcare needs during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic was difficult because case dynamics changed rapidly with the implementation and relaxation of non-pharmaceutical measures, behavioural changes, vaccination and emerging variants, limiting forecasting horizon to a couple of weeks or even days. As COVID-19 moved to endemicity, we hypothesised that the predictability of future COVID-19 epidemics would depend on the regularity of dynamics in successive epidemic waves. We aimed to model and compare epidemic growth rate dynamics in the waves observed since March 2022 (after the dominance of the Omicron variant) and to use this model to improve COVID-19 forecast horizons by incorporating information from completed waves in the prediction. We propose a 4-phase, piecewise-sinusoidal model that approximates the growth rate trajectory of any individual wave of COVID-19-related emergency room (ER) visits in metropolitan France and use the parameters of past approximations to forecast future ER visits. We first estimate the smoothed trendline of ER visits and its associated growth rate curve from the raw time series. Next, we use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to fit our model to the growth rate series for L − 1 past waves. Finally, we let these historical model estimates inform the prior distribution of the subsequent, L-th wave against the uncertain real-time growth rate data to compute the ongoing wave’s posterior distribution. As our proposed model directly corresponds to the geometry of the trendline for one complete wave, we can easily compute statistics such as the timing and magnitude of the peak. We evaluated our method on two Omicron waves beginning in September (L = 3) and November 2022 (L = 4): The median forecasted timing error was 6.3 ± 6.5 days and 5.7 ± 5.0 days of the true peak date up to the dates of respective peaks. The median forecasted magnitude error was 16 ± 34% and 18 ± 23% from the true peak magnitude up to the dates of respective peaks. Our method could be used to analyse other infectious diseases with semi-regular growth rate patterns such as influenza. For such diseases, characterising the regularity in past waves may be essential for improving the forecasts of epidemic waves.\nMatthew Shin is a PhD student at Sorbonne Université, under the supervision of Prof Simon Cauchemez and Dr Juliette Paireau at the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases Unit at Institut Pasteur in Paris, France. Prior to starting his thesis, he studied applied mathematics at the University of Chicago and worked as a computational scientist at a biomedical start-up. His research interests focus on generalisable mathematical and statistical methods to analyse real-world spatiotemporal data, especially those that fall under the umbrella of ‘scientific machine learning’ (SciML).\nA recording of this talk will be posted to our YouTube channel and asynchronous discussion will be possible on our community site.

These are represented by the lighter shaded squares in the reporting triangle and the bars on the right.\nCorrecting for this systematic downward bias by making estimates of the yet-to-be-observed counts to estimate the “final” count, is called nowcasting. For more on nowcasting in practice, check out Johannes Bracher’s post about the German COVID-19 Nowcast Hub challenge.\n\n\n\n\nSchematic figure depicting the reporting triangle (left) where rows are “reference times”, e.g. symptom onset date or date of hospital admissions and columns are reporting delays, and numbers indicate the number of incident cases at that reference time and reporting delay.

    "text": "Why/when should I care about it?\n\nMainly because it’s very common in epidemiology, and interpreting the data at face value will be misleading! Systematic downward bias is likely to occur any time case counts are indexed by an event that occurs before reporting and/or when data comes in from different sources with different reporting lags (for example if ED visits are reported by multiple facilities and each facility reports on a different day of the week)\nIn public health practice, this is often “handled” by shortening time series to remove the partially observed data, or shading over it to indicate its incompleteness, or in some cases leaving as is despite it being so easily misinterpreted.\nHere’s an example from the 2024-2025 measles outbreak in the U.S. Cases are indexed by the date of rash onset – which means in real-time cases are getting assigned to previous dates. It takes time from the onset of rash to seek healthcare, through test collection and processing, and finally to reporting the test results, which means the delay between rash onset and when that case appears in the data can be many weeks. On May 15, 2025, we will not be aware of any rash onsets on that day, and only very few, even from the previous week, resulting in the characteristic downward bias we see in this data. At the time, cases were in fact declining, but due to right-truncation, it was difficult to disentangle whether this was a decline or simply missing reports.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of cases from the U.S. CDC’s website showing the number of national measles cases indexed by rash onset date.

This shows daily same-day nowcasts compared to the initial reports as of the nowcast date (gray) and the final observed counts (red). The default method doesn’t account for weekday effects in reporting and as a result exhibits strong weekday periodicity, whereas the weekday filter method is much smoother because it knows to expect certain delays on certain weekdays.\n\n\n\n\nExample of daily same-day nowcasts from the default baselinenowcast specification (purple) and the specification that fits reporting delays to each weekday (light blue) compared to the finally observed data (red) and the data available as of the nowcast date (gray).\n\n\n\nWe also compared the performance of multiple baselinenowcast specifications to models used to nowcast norovirus in England from UKHSA, which had been evaluated in a previous study (Mellor et al.

We aimed to have no mathematical equations and to try to limit ourselves to 4,000 words. While writing the paper, we realized that there was no good summary of all the things to consider when estimating or using delay distributions. Because of this gap, we decided to broaden the scope of the paper to include other aspects that should be considered when estimating delays. The approach we took was heavily inspired by Gostic et al.’s paper on Rt and Lipsitch et al.’s paper on case fatality risks. The result was a set of guidelines for anyone generating or assessing estimates of delays."

    "text": "Epidemiological delay distributions are important\nEpidemiological delay distributions provide key information for influencing epidemic situational awareness, control strategies, and resource allocation. Examples of delay distributions include the incubation period, serial interval, and reporting delays. The incubation period is the time between infection and symptom onset, the serial interval is the time between symptom onset in a primary case and symptom onset in a secondary case, and the reporting delay is the time between symptom onset (or other primary indicator) and reporting of a case. These distributions are critical for understanding the dynamics of an epidemic. They can also be used to help estimate the effectiveness of control measures, for example by helping to account for the time between implementation of a control measure and any related observed reduction in transmission."

    "text": "Estimating delay distributions is challenging\nEstimating delay distributions is challenging because of the presence of various sources of biases and the lack of widespread adoption (mainly due to the lack of availability and knowledge) of robust methods for accounting for these biases. The main sources of bias to consider in commonly available data are:\n\nRight truncation: Right truncation describes the incomplete observation of delays, for which the primary event already occurred but the secondary event has not been observed (e.g. infections that have not yet become symptomatic and therefore not been observed). Right truncation generally leads to underestimation of the mean if not properly accounted for.\nInterval censoring: Interval censoring arises when epidemiological events occurring in continuous time are binned into time intervals (e.g., days or weeks). Double censoring of both primary and secondary events is common and is often neglected, leading to biased estimates.\nDynamical bias: Dynamical biases describe the effects of an epidemic’s current growth or decay rate on the observed delay distributions. When epidemic is growing (decaying), we are more likely to observe shorter (longer) intervals, giving biased estimates.\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of biases in estimating delay distributions (Figure 1 from our preprint)"

    "section": "What did we find?",
    "text": "What did we find?\n\nMany methods exist but are either not widely used or have limitations\nWe found a wide range of methods in the literature to account for these biases but the majority of these were ad-hoc and unable to fully account for all sources of biases or introduced biases of their own. We also found that many of these methods were not widely used in practice, likely due to the lack of availability of software implementations and the lack of knowledge of these methods.\n\n\nIn general, accounting for right truncation (and interval censoring) is sufficient\nA key confusion in the literature was the interaction between dynamic bias and right truncation. In this work, we show that when an epidemic is growing and the aim is to estimate the forward distibution then dynamical bias and right truncation are effectively equivalent and only one of these biases needs to be accounted for. In general, we found that it was often most practical to account for right truncation as this does not require knowledge of the current trajector of the epidemic.\n\n\nInterval censoring is often neglected or mishandled\nWe found that interval censoring was often neglected or mishandled in the literature. We found that this was often due to a lack of understanding of the difference between single interval censoring and double interval censoring. We also found that many methods that attempted to account for interval censoring did so incorrectly, leading to biased estimates. However, we found that simple approximations, such as assuming a uniform interval of the sum of the primary and secondary events provided an adequate approximation in many cases. We also found that using a latent variable approach, where both the primary and secondary events are modelled as latent variables, provided a robust approach and improved performance. This approacch was also relatively easy to implement.\n\n\nSo which method should I use?\nWe identified the method of Ward et al. to be the best performing method. However, this method relies on implicit approximations, which may not hold for more complicated scenarios.\nWe also introduced and tested two new methods that utilize both incidence time series and delay data. They demonstrated good performance under certain conditions, but they also had inherent limitations depending on the setting.\nWe find that all methods that we considered had residual biases even when we tried to account for all sources of biases. This is because of a simplifying assumption that the event time is uniformly distributed within the censoring interval. While this is a common assumption, we show that this is generally not true and provide a theoretical framework for dealing with this issue."

    "text": "What are the limitations and future directions?\nAll methods we considered here rely on simplifying assumptions. While we lay out mathematical theory for the exact method that does not rely on simplifying assumptions, we did not implement or test this method yet.\nWe currently lack a statistically sound method that is able to account for temporal changes in continuous-time epidemiological distributions while adjusting for other sources of biases. Specifically, accounting for changes in the forward distribution requires a cohort-based approach based on primary event time. However, the presence of interval censoring in primary event time adds challenges to assigning each individual into cohorts because uncertainty in primary event time need to be taken into account.\nThere are many other sources of biases that may occur during the data collection or cleaning processes which we did not consider in this study.\nWe primarily focused on estimating single-individual delays, such as the incubation period or reporting delay. There are additional challenges to estimating transmission intervals that involve more than one person, such as uncertainties in who infected whom. While the methods we considered in this paper can be used to estimate transmission interval distributions, additional attention is needed to consider other sources of biases.\nFor more details, please see our preprint."

Motivated by these challenges and committed to improving future response efforts, we, a group of 27 members from the UK infectious disease modelling community, convened for a reflective workshop in March 2023.

We then aggregated pairs into groups of increasing size in order to generalise personal experiences into themes. This approach fostered an understanding of the individual experiences that constituted our collective response effort.\nFollowing these discussions, we collectively identified and categorised emergent issues for epidemic response work into themes. These were:\n\nFunding and institutional support: Participants reported insufficient institutional support and contract insecurity due to reliance on external grant funding, impacting both academic and professional services roles. Recognitions, rewards, and access: Current reward metrics were deemed inadequate, with unequal credit attribution and limited access to policy-making spaces.\nTeam and work dynamics: Issues included insufficient capacity, competing demands, barriers to progression, and both positive and negative aspects of collaborative working.\nNon-academic contributions: The importance of professional services staff and collaboration with public health agency workers were highlighted.\nPersonal impacts: Public recognition led to both increased visibility and challenges; mental ill health and burnout were prevalent; balancing work with personal commitments was difficult for many.\n\nWe recognise that many of these issues impact those in our field outside of an epidemic response but believe that they are a particular issue for work of this kind. We also acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic has engendered widespread hardship, stress, and ill health throughout various populations, and it is crucial to reflect on and address these profound impacts across all strata of society, not just in our community."

    "section": "Priority recommendations",
    "text": "Priority recommendations\nThe workshop proposed the following priority recommendations to improve support and sustainability for future epidemic response work:\n\nAcknowledge and reward impactful response work at institution, funder, and research community levels. For example, refining impact measures to credit all forms of output produced during, and required for, response work; institutions could incorporate response-driven work into criteria for doctoral theses and promotion.\nEncourage routine interaction between academia and public health agencies, including consistently reviewing the appropriate allocation of epidemic response tasks. One potential solution is creating sustainable dual positions recruiting from both sectors.\nEnsure response teams are well-staffed, well-resourced, stable, and provided psychological support. This approach reduces dependence on key individuals. One approach is to establish sustainable team-building and training programmes during non-response periods.\nIncrease the transparency of the evidence pathway from scientists to decision-makers. This makes it easier for those across the scientific community to contribute as well as making the evidence base for decisions clearer to the general public. This could be achieved by standardising rapid open access to the minutes of scientific advisory meetings.\nImplement best practices for a sustainable work environment. Employers and team leads can promote leave-taking and respecting work hours, clarify communication about processes and rewards across career stages, prepare for, and standardise, the onboarding of new team members, and integrate support roles.\n\nAchieving these changes necessitates investment from governments, funding bodies, and institutions. Teams may need to redefine their working methods to place greater emphasis on well-being, training, and career development. While localised initiatives require time investment from those leading them, they must be supported to foster a healthier and more sustainable environment for future epidemic response work.\nAs it stands, future epidemic responses are likely to raise similar challenges to those we have identified here, including reliance on a select number of individuals, excessive workloads and the exacerbation of systemic inequalities. It is critical we act outside of response contexts, for example by implementing the recommendations we have outlined, to mitigate these issues and respond more effectively in future."

    "section": "The indicator and the challenge",
    "text": "The indicator and the challenge\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, epidemiological indicators have become part of our everyday life. Early on, deaths were the only reliable measure in many places. Then, for a long time, we were staring at case numbers, and later measures of healthcare burden became central. In Germany, where I work, the 7-day COVID-19 hospitalization incidence became a central indicator in Fall 2021 (with thresholds linked to levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions). However, this indicator has its peculiarities and quickly prompted some public debate (see e.g., this automatic translation of a German-language news item). One difficulty (I’ll gloss over a few other questions) is its timeliness. The issue arises from its very definition: the 7-day hopitalization incidence is (roughly speaking) the number of people who were reported to have a positive COVID-19 test during said 7-day period and later, and not necessarily during the same 7 days, got admitted to hospital. So hospitalizations are counted by when a positive test rather than when the actual hospitalization was reported. This way, in addition to the classical reporting delay, a second delay is baked into the indicator - the time it takes from a positive test to hospitalization. As a consequence, it can take a really long time until data are finally complete. Especially recent values are biased downwards and one can easily get the impression of a downward trend where there isn’t actually one. We therefore figured that statistical nowcasting - predicting what the numbers will look like once all data are complete - was a really relevant task here.\n\n\n\nIllustration of data updates and the nowcasting tasks. Coloured lines show data as available at different point in time. Blue lines and shaded areas show the nowcasts issued in real time. A clear downward dip at the end of each version of the time series is visible, which disappears when data are revised."

    "text": "The collaborative format\nIf you are in the epidemic modelling sphere, you may have come across the various COVID-19 Forecast Hubs which bring together epidemiological predictions from various models, systematically compare them and merge them into so-called ensembles. While one conclusion from these efforts is that predicting COVID-19 is really hard, a more positive finding is that combining different models can somewhat enhance performance (see e.g., here and here). When the political decision was taken to make the 7-day hospitalization incidence the main pandemic indicator in Germany, we figured it was an interesting setting to apply this approach to nowcasting. Specifically, we had two goals:\n\nWhile Robert Koch Institute, the German Federal Public Health Institute, was showing figures of nowcasts in its weekly reports, no operational and re-usable nowcasts were available to be displayed along with real-time data.\nWhen first looking into the problem, we realized that there was a large number of nowcasting methods, but little was known about their actual real-time behaviour nor their relative performance. Also, nobody had tried to combine several nowcasting models into an ensemble nowcast.\n\nWe therefore reached out to a few people we knew were working on related topics and set up a GitHub repository with pre-processed data as well as a visualization dashboard to make their contribution as easy as possible. People got on board astonishingly quickly and a few days later we had several nowcasting models up and running, and posted a study protocol for our methods comparison."

    "section": "The lessons",
    "text": "The lessons\nIf you are interested in the detailed results our preprint has you covered. I’ll just say a few words about my main learnings:\n\nReassuringly, all models we considered were doing something reasonable (see figure), and most of the time they were able to give a realistic idea of current trends. Every now and then, nowcasts were also considerably off. Typically, that happened when reporting practices changed, and most models were affected in a similar manner.\nOne of the main challenges was to get weekday effects under control (there are two of them - one for the date of positive test, one for the date of hospitalization). Our purposefully simple “reference model” KIT does not take this aspect into account and consequently looks like an ill-calibrated cardiogram.\n\n\n\n\nSame-day nowcasts (with a horizon of 0 days) of the 7-day hospitalization incidence as issued on each day of the study period. Nowcasts are shown for the German national level pooled across all age groups.\n\n\n\nUncertainty quantification turned out to be tricky. Almost none of the models issued prediction intervals reaching nominal coverage levels. One important learning was that purely model-based uncertainty quantification (like your model’s predictive posterior distribution) does not work all that well in practice. Two approaches which looked at errors of past nowcasts fared much better (sort of poor man’s versions of conformal prediction).\nDefining a nowcasting target is not as trivial as it seems. We somewhat naively defined it as “the final version of the time series”, which in practice we assumed would be available 100 days after the last day for which we generated nowcasts. However, it turned out that the data were still changing after these 100 days. Only slightly, but enough to have an impact on results. Looking back, rather than using the data version available on a specified date, a better idea might have been to define the target as all hospitalizations reported with a maximum delay of, say, 40 days.\nAs in similar previous projects, combined emsemble predictions showed promising results. On our pre-specified original target, they actually came in second and were beaten quite clearly by one of the individual models. That, however, seemed to be due to a peculiar overlay of a few different biases working in different directions (it’s a long discussion, check out the paper). Personally I am optimistic that across different settings there is something to be gained from ensemble nowcasts."

    "text": "How nowcasts have been used\nGiven the sudden prominence of the 7-day hospitalization incidence in the management of the pandemic in Germany, in fall and winter 2021 there was considerable interest in the nowcasts we made available. Many media outlets are now winding down their COVID dashboards, but e.g., at newspaper Die Zeit and public broadcaster NDR, the nowcasts are still routinely displayed in May 2023. Following some very productive exchange with colleagues from Robert Koch Institute, our platform has also been referred to in their weekly reports (accompanying their own nowcasts).\nAn interesting aspect in the exchange with data journalists was that they were sort of hesitant to use the ensemble nowcast. After all, it was based on a difficult-to-understand mix of methods, some of which not yet formally peer-reviewed. Understandably, for them it made sense to have one specific method to point to, published in a journal of known reputation. A positive experience was that at least some media outlets took care to communicate the uncertainty associated with nowcasts explicitly."

The COVID-19 pandemic put field epidemiology under unprecedented demand and scrutiny. In this talk, Dr Hammer will give a personal perspective on how field epidemiologists are trained and how the future of this field can look like, particularly with a focus on collaboration with other key actors for health protection including mathematical modelers. This talk should be of interest both to members of the epinowcast community who are considering applying for field epidemiology training as well as those working with field epidemiologists or planning to.\nDr Hammer is the Everitt Butterfield Research Fellow in Biomedical Sciences at Downing College, University of Cambridge and a member of the Cambridge Infectious Diseases (CID) Steering Committee. In May she has taken on interim duties as senior epidemiologist and coordinator of the German Field Epidemiology Training Programme at the Robert Koch-Institute. Charlotte specialises in the epidemiology of emerging and high consequence infectious diseases, covering aspects such as risk factor identification, development of novel surveillance and outbreak response systems, and global health security. Her primary research interests are outbreaks at the human-animal-environment interface using a One Health lens, and the epidemiology of infectious diseases in conflict zones and other complex and fragile settings. Having worked for and across academia, national and international health emergency response, policy and the UN system, she has been involved in the COVID-19 response in the European Union and Papua New Guinea and in the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In addition to her academic work, she maintains a strong involvement in public health emergency response and epidemic intelligence through deployments with organisations such as the World Health Organization and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (for which she is also the CID Focal Point) as well as through capacity building for field epidemiology training programs across the world.\nA recording of this talk will be posted to our YouTube channel and asynchronous discussion will be possible on our community site.

This work was developed in collaboration with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Brazil, which supports the Ministry of Health in monitoring cases of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and COVID-19. The approach is motivated by the operational warning system currently used for SARI surveillance, where forecasts for total SARI cases and those testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 are produced independently. To improve nowcasting predictions and support decision-making, they propose a joint modelling framework that accounts for the nested structure of the data. To facilitate adoption, they developed an accompanying R package, NimbleCast, which enables streamlined implementation of the framework within existing workflows.\nAlba Halliday is a Research Associate at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London.

    "text": "Abstract\nBeginning in May 2022, Mpox virus spread rapidly in high-income countries through close human-to-human contact primarily amongst communities of gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men (GBMSM). The epidemiology of Mpox in the United Kingdom suggested that a full network model of sexual contacts could be an appropriate modelling framework for making inferences on key quantities (e.g. the risk of transmission per contact), generating probabilistic forecasts of the future Mpox trajectory and performing scenario-based projections. However, full network models are computationally intensive and complicated to calibrate, which in practical terms makes them difficult to operationalize. We present a stochastic discrete-population transmission model which includes GBMSM status, rate of formation of new sexual partnerships. The social structure underlying the transmission of Mpox was represented as a randomly sized clique partitioning of the population; which was inferred along with other parameters. Moreover, given increasingly wide-spread public awareness of Mpox over the summer of 2022, it seemed possible that actions taken by the public aimed at decreasing personal risk of contracting Mpox could impact the epidemic curve in the United Kingdom. Towards capturing this public response to the epidemic, we considered both individual behaviour change and uptake of the modified Vaccinia-based vaccine Imvanex/Jynneos."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On Wednesday the 3rd of July at 3pm UK time, Dr Juliette Unwin will talk about using Hawkes Processes to model malaria in low transmission settings.\nGlobally there were an estimated 249 million malaria cases and 608,000 malaria deaths in 85 countries during 2022, predominantly in Africa, with 34 countries reporting fewer than 1000 indigenous cases of the disease. Modelling malaria in low transmission settings is challenging because prohibitively large sample sizes are needed to use traditional gold standard measures such as parasite prevalence. Instead, Dr Unwin proposes using Hawkes Processes to capture malaria disease dynamics in countries that are close to eliminating malaria. The model combines malaria specific information, such as the shape of the infectious profile, within a rigorous statistical framework to fit incidence data. She will discuss how it is possible to accurately recreate the case counts over time with our Hawkes Process method. She will also discuss how it is possible to estimate the proportion of cases that are imported without using this information in the fitting process.\nDr Unwin is a lecturer in Statistical Science at the University of Bristol. Her research focuses on developing novel methods for infectious disease response and has worked on diseases such as malaria, Ebola and COVID-19.

    "section": "",
    "text": "On Wednesday the 5th of February at 3pm UK time, Friederike (Rike) Becker will discuss the influence of ensemble size and composition on performance of combined real-time COVID-19 forecasts.\nDuring infectious disease outbreaks, short-term forecasts can play an important role for both decision makers and the public. While previous research has shown that combining individual forecasts into an ensemble improves accuracy and consistency, practical guidance for organisers of multi-model prediction platforms on how to construct an ensemble has been scarce. In particular, it is unclear how ensemble performance relates to the size of the underlying model base, a relevant question when relying on voluntary contributions from modelling teams that face competing priorities. Furthermore, the exact composition of an ensemble forecast may influence its performance. Centrally, such a method can either include all models equally or, alternatively, discriminate based on models’ merit or other non-performance-related characteristics. Using data from the European Covid-19 Forecast Hub, we investigate these questions, with the aim of offering practical guidance for organisers of multi-model prediction platforms during infectious disease outbreaks. We found that including more models both improved and stabilized aggregate ensemble performance, while selecting for better component models did not yield any particular advantage. Diversity among models, whether measured numerically or qualitatively, did not have a clear impact on ensemble performance. These results suggest that for those soliciting contributions to collaborative ensembles there are more obvious gains to be made from increasing participation to moderate levels than from optimising component models.\nFriederike (Rike) Becker is a PhD student at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). Previously, she has obtained a MSc in Applied Statistics at the University of Göttingen and has written her masters thesis under the supervision of Nikos Bosse at LSHTM. Her current research lies at the intersection of statistics and economics, with a particular research interest in forecasting.\nA recording of this talk will be posted to our YouTube channel and asynchronous discussion will be possible on our community site.

    "text": "Abstract\nThe generation interval, defined as the time between when an individual becomes infected and when they infect another person, is a fundamental quantity describing the infection process. However, measuring generation intervals in practice can be challenging because infection events are rarely observed. Instead, serial intervals, defined as the time between when an individual develops symptoms and when their infectee develops symptoms, are often used as a substitute.

    "text": "Abstract\nIn June of 2022, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Mpox Response wanted timely answers to important epidemiological questions which can now be answered more effectively through infectious disease modeling. Infectious disease models have shown to be valuable tool for decision making during outbreaks; however, model complexity often makes communicating the results and limitations of models to decision makers difficult. We performed nowcasting and forecasting for the 2022 mpox outbreak in the United States using the R package EpiNow2. We generated nowcasts/forecasts at the national level, by Census region, and for jurisdictions reporting the greatest number of mpox cases. Modeling results were shared for situational awareness within the CDC Mpox Response and publicly on the CDC website. We retrospectively evaluated forecast predictions at four key phases during the outbreak using three metrics, the weighted interval score, mean absolute error, and prediction interval coverage. We compared the performance of EpiNow2 with a naïve Bayesian generalized linear model (GLM). The EpiNow2 model had less probabilistic error than the GLM during every outbreak phase except for the early phase. We share our experiences with an existing tool for nowcasting/forecasting and highlight areas of improvement for the development of future tools. We also reflect on lessons learned regarding data quality issues and adapting modeling results for different audiences."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On Wednesday September 3rd, Kaitlyn Johnson will discuss baseline methods for nowcasting and its applications. This work has recently been posted as a pre-print.\nReporting delays in public health surveillance systems can create a misleading impression of declining trends in recent data. While a number of “nowcasting” methods have been developed to correct this bias, widespread adoption in public health practice has yet to be realized. Currently, there is no simple method to perform nowcasting that both meets the needs of public health practice and can be used as a benchmark for further methodological advancement. In this work, we present a family of baseline nowcasting methods, and an accompanying software package, baselinenowcast, designed specifically to address these two gaps. We evaluate the performance of the default method against other methods used in previous studies and assess the performance of different method specifications. Our findings indicate that our baseline methods improve performance over unadjusted data or more ad-hoc baseline nowcasting approaches, provide an interpretable and accessible nowcasting solution for public health practice, and are useful as a standard benchmark for more advanced methods.\nKaitlyn is currently an Assistant Professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine working in Sebastian Funk’s Epiforecasts group. Prior to joining, she worked as a data scientist at the U.S. CDC’s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics.

    "text": "On Wednesday the 2nd of April at 3pm UK time, Kylie Ainslie will talk about her work on scabies.\nScabies is a contagious skin disease caused by the infestation of the skin by the Sarcopes scabiei mite, resulting in an itchy rash. Scabies affects over 400 million people worldwide each year. A rise in scabies cases has been observed in recent years throughout Western Europe. Despite the high prevalence of scabies in parts of the world and increasing scabies cases across Europe, some key epidemiological characteristics describing the spread of scabies infections have not been described, such as the serial interval – the time between symptom onset in an infector and symptom onset in an infectee – and the reproduction number – the average number of people an infected person will go on to infect. Accurate estimates of the epidemiological characteristics describing the spread of scabies are essential for designing effective control strategies to curb disease transmission. In this talk, Kylie will present work on estimating these key epidemiological characteristics of scabies using various mathematical methods and data sources. She will also introduce mitey, an R package she developed that enables researchers and public health professionals to apply these methods for their own analyses. This open-source tool facilitates reproducibility and allows users to estimate key parameters such as the serial interval and reproduction number using their own datasets. Finally, she will discuss the policy implications of these findings and how they can inform the design of strategies to prevent future outbreaks.\nDr. Kylie Ainslie is an infectious disease modeller at the Dutch National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and an Honorary Assistant Professor at the University of Hong Kong School of Public Health. Her work at RIVM focuses on using mathematical models of infectious disease transmission to determine the impact of vaccination strategies on disease spread, and the development of statistical methods to determine how vaccine-induced protection wanes over time. At the University of Hong Kong, her work focuses on determining the real-world protection provided by vaccines against respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19 and influenza. Kylie strongly believes in open-source and reproducible research and loves coding in R.\nA recording of this talk will be posted to our YouTube channel and asynchronous discussion will be possible on our community site.
