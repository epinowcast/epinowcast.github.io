  <title>Baseline nowcasting methods for handling delays in epidemiological data</title>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Delays in epidemiological data can lead to systematic downward bias in recent data, resulting in misleading trends in real-time data used for public health-decision making. Methods to adjust for this bias via nowcasting lack an established baseline method. This gap limits both methodological development and practical adoption in public health. We address these needs with the <code>baselinenowcast</code> R package, which implements an empirically-driven chain ladder nowcasting method. The chain ladder approach, adapted from actuarial science, uses historical reporting patterns to estimate not-yet-reported cases. We adopted an implementation of this method from the German COVID-19 Nowcast Hub, where it served as a reference model. After verifying our implementation reproduced the original nowcasts, we tested specifications tailored to common epidemiological scenarios. The method consistently outperformed simpler baseline approaches. Performance improved further when tuned to specific epidemiological contexts. The <code>baselinenowcast</code> package provides modular functions that make implementation straightforward for practitioners.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-nowcasting">What is nowcasting?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Delays in reporting of epidemiological events can create a misleading impression of declining trends in recent data because recent counts of these events are under-represented.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, if we index cases by symptom onset in real-time, the cases from the most recent time will be incomplete because cases reported with longer delays have yet to be observed, i.e.&nbsp;these events are “right-truncated”. These are represented by the lighter shaded squares in the reporting triangle and the bars on the right.</p></li>
<li><p>Correcting for this systematic downward bias by making estimates of the yet-to-be-observed counts to estimate the “final” count, is called nowcasting. For more on nowcasting in practice, check out Johannes Bracher’s post about the German COVID-19 Nowcast Hub challenge.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whywhen-should-i-care-about-it">Why/when should I care about it?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Mainly because it’s very common in epidemiology, and interpreting the data at face value will be misleading! Systematic downward bias is likely to occur any time case counts are indexed by an event that occurs before reporting and/or when data comes in from different sources with different reporting lags (for example if ED visits are reported by multiple facilities and each facility reports on a different day of the week)</p></li>
<li><p>In public health practice, this is often “handled” by shortening time series to remove the partially observed data, or shading over it to indicate its incompleteness, or in some cases leaving as is despite it being so easily misinterpreted.</p></li>
<li><p>Here’s an example from the 2024-2025 measles outbreak in the U.S. Cases are indexed by the date of rash onset – which means in real-time cases are getting assigned to previous dates. It takes time from the onset of rash to seek healthcare, through test collection and processing, and finally to reporting the test results, which means the delay between rash onset and when that case appears in the data can be many weeks. On May 15, 2025, we will not be aware of any rash onsets on that day, and only very few, even from the previous week, resulting in the characteristic downward bias we see in this data. At the time, cases were in fact declining, but due to right-truncation, it was difficult to disentangle whether this was a decline or simply missing reports.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-can-we-do-about-it">What can we do about it?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A number of nowcasting methods have been developed to handle this exact phenomena <span class="citation" data-cites="meyer2017spatio">Meyer, Held, and Höhle (2017)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="abbott2021epinowcast">Abbott et al.

(2025)</span>, at the U.S. CDC for visual display of trends in ILI <span class="citation" data-cites="cdc_respnet_2025">CDC (2025)</span>, and in Massachusetts for COVID-19 admissions <span class="citation" data-cites="massachusetts_syndromic_surveillance"><span>“Massachusetts Syndromic Surveillance Data and Moving Epidemic Method”</span> (n.d.)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>However, these are still the exception, as is exemplified by the U.S. CDC’s measles dashboard <span class="citation" data-cites="cdc_measles_data_2025">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2025)</span>, with routine nowcast correction still lacking widespread public health adoption.</p></li>
<li><p>We identified two critical gaps in this space:</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There isn’t an empirically-driven, relatively straightforward tool catered to the epidemiological context that can fill the <span class="citation" data-cites="Wolffram2023">Wolffram et al. (2023)</span> needs of public health practitioners.</p></li>
<li><p>While there are several complex methods for nowcasting, there isn’t a baseline method that can be used as a reference model for other methods to be compared against.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="what-did-we-do" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-did-we-do">What did we do?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>To address these two gaps, we developed an R package, called baselinenowcast which implements an empirically-driven chain ladder method, based on the approach used by <span class="citation" data-cites="Wolffram2023">Wolffram et al. (2023)</span> as a reference model in the German COVID Nowcast Hub <span class="citation" data-cites="hospitalization_nowcast_hub_2025">KITmetricslab et al. (2025)</span> challenge in 2021 and 2022.</p></li>
<li><p>It has a modular function-based interface that enables inspection of the individual components at each step in the nowcasting procedure, which are outlined in the schematic figure.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>The package has a number of features specifically catered to common epidemiological contexts (such as the ability to borrow estimates from different strata or to change the target to compute say 7-day rolling sums), and documentation tailored to infectious disease surveillance problems.</li>

</section>
<section id="how-did-we-validate-the-method" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-did-we-validate-the-method">How did we validate the method?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We first verified that the method produced equivalent outputs to the one it was based on in the German COVID-19 Nowcast Hub.</p></li>
<li><p>Then we tested out different method specifications that are available as options in the baselinenowcast package and compared the performance of these modifications to the package default applied to COVID-19 data.</p></li>
<li><p>Below is an example comparing the performance of the default baselinenowcast specification (in purple) to a modification which estimates separate delay distributions by weekday (light blue). This shows daily same-day nowcasts compared to the initial reports as of the nowcast date (gray) and the final observed counts (red). The default method doesn’t account for weekday effects in reporting and as a result exhibits strong weekday periodicity, whereas the weekday filter method is much smoother because it knows to expect certain delays on certain weekdays.</p></li>
</ul>

</div>
<ul>
<li>We also compared the performance of multiple baselinenowcast specifications to models used to nowcast norovirus in England from UKHSA, which had been evaluated in a previous study (<span class="citation" data-cites="mellor2025application">Mellor et al. (2025)</span>), including a previously used baseline method and what is currently used in public health practice.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="key-takeaways" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-takeaways">Key takeaways:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>baselinenowcast</code> method consistently improved performance over unadjusted data.</p></li>
<li><p>It also performed better than other baseline methods used in previous studies, including those that were developed ad-hoc for specific purposes</p></li>
<li><p>The default performed well when we applied it to COVID-19 and likely is a reasonable first pass that someone could use out of the box.</p></li>
<li><p>Exploratory data analysis of the delay distributions revealed differences by age group and weekday effects – tuning our <code>baselinenowcast</code> specification to account for this improved performance over the default, and we recommend tuning it for your context.</p></li>
<li><p>Using <code>baselinenowcast</code> compared to other methods helped us better understand the strengths and weaknesses of those methods.</p></li>

  <title>Best practices for estimating and reporting epidemiological delay distributions of infectious diseases using public health surveillance and healthcare data</title>

<section id="what-did-we-do" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-did-we-do">What did we do?</h2>
<p>Epidemiological delay distributions tend to come up during nearly every infectious disease outbreak because they inform public health policy and clinical practice. We recently posted a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08841">preprint</a> about best practices for estimating and reporting epidemiological delay distributions of infectious diseases. <em>Echoing <a href="https://x.com/seabbs/status/1746890371181764804?s=43&amp;t=NlWugkchLZeQDrJGRDwx7w">Sam</a>, this is the paper I wish I had read prior to the 2022 mpox outbreak when I was a Prevention Effectiveness Fellow at the CDC Poxvirus and Rabies Branch.</em></p>

<section id="why-did-we-do-it" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-did-we-do-it">Why did we do it?</h2>
<p>The manuscript was inspired by another <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.12.24301247v1">preprint</a> led by Sang Woo Park. That preprint mainly focused on the biases that can affect delays and methods for adjustment. Originally, we wanted to increase the accessibility of that work by summarizing it. Our target audience would be people with data, such as those who work for public health agencies. We aimed to have no mathematical equations and to try to limit ourselves to 4,000 words. While writing the paper, we realized that there was no good summary of all the things to consider when estimating or using delay distributions. Because of this gap, we decided to broaden the scope of the paper to include other aspects that should be considered when estimating delays. The approach we took was heavily inspired by <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008409">Gostic et al.’s paper on Rt</a> and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003846">Lipsitch et al.’s paper on case fatality risks</a>. The result was a set of guidelines for anyone generating or assessing estimates of delays.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-takeaways">Key takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>A number of items are necessary for understanding the context of delay estimates and should be reported whenever possible to maximize utility, such as study sample size; the epidemic curve; which, if any, control measures are in place, etc.</li>
<li>Not adjusting for routinely present bias (such as interval censoring and right truncation) can lead to incorrect estimates of delays, which can have direct implications for public health practice. See below and the preprint for a handy flow chart!</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/epinowcast/epidist">epidist R package</a> is the only software tool to our knowledge that correctly handles interval censoring, right truncation, and dynamical bias</li>
<li>There is more work to do in improving methods that can robustly handle common biases and making these widely available.</li>

<p><em>This blog post is based on a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.12.24301247v1">preprint</a> we recently posted with a large authorship group.

<section id="epidemiological-delay-distributions-are-important" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="epidemiological-delay-distributions-are-important">Epidemiological delay distributions are important</h2>
<p>Epidemiological delay distributions provide key information for influencing epidemic situational awareness, control strategies, and resource allocation. Examples of delay distributions include the incubation period, serial interval, and reporting delays. The incubation period is the time between infection and symptom onset, the serial interval is the time between symptom onset in a primary case and symptom onset in a secondary case, and the reporting delay is the time between symptom onset (or other primary indicator) and reporting of a case. These distributions are critical for understanding the dynamics of an epidemic. They can also be used to help estimate the effectiveness of control measures, for example by helping to account for the time between implementation of a control measure and any related observed reduction in transmission.</p>
</section>
<section id="estimating-delay-distributions-is-challenging" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="estimating-delay-distributions-is-challenging">Estimating delay distributions is challenging</h2>
<p>Estimating delay distributions is challenging because of the presence of various sources of biases and the lack of widespread adoption (mainly due to the lack of availability and knowledge) of robust methods for accounting for these biases. The main sources of bias to consider in commonly available data are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Right truncation</strong>: Right truncation describes the incomplete observation of delays, for which the primary event already occurred but the secondary event has not been observed (e.g.&nbsp;infections that have not yet become symptomatic and therefore not been observed). Right truncation generally leads to underestimation of the mean if not properly accounted for.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interval censoring</strong>: Interval censoring arises when epidemiological events occurring in continuous time are binned into time intervals (e.g., days or weeks). Double censoring of both primary and secondary events is common and is often neglected, leading to biased estimates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dynamical bias</strong>: Dynamical biases describe the effects of an epidemic’s current growth or decay rate on the observed delay distributions. When epidemic is growing (decaying), we are more likely to observe shorter (longer) intervals, giving biased estimates.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-what-did-we-do">So what did we do?</h2>
<p>In this study, we give an overview of the biases in estimating these distributions and consider various methods, both commonly used in the literature and novel, that address these challenges. We evaluate the performance of each method against both simulations and real-world data. Our study also lays out the theoretical foundation for estimating epidemiological distributions, practical guidance on making statistical inferences, and provides a set of tools to implement this guidance.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="many-methods-exist-but-are-either-not-widely-used-or-have-limitations">Many methods exist but are either not widely used or have limitations</h3>
<p>We found a wide range of methods in the literature to account for these biases but the majority of these were ad-hoc and unable to fully account for all sources of biases or introduced biases of their own. We also found that many of these methods were not widely used in practice, likely due to the lack of availability of software implementations and the lack of knowledge of these methods.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-general-accounting-for-right-truncation-and-interval-censoring-is-sufficient">In general, accounting for right truncation (<em>and interval censoring</em>) is sufficient</h3>
<p>A key confusion in the literature was the interaction between dynamic bias and right truncation. In this work, we show that when an epidemic is growing and the aim is to estimate the forward distibution then dynamical bias and right truncation are effectively equivalent and only one of these biases needs to be accounted for. In general, we found that it was often most practical to account for right truncation as this does not require knowledge of the current trajector of the epidemic.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interval-censoring-is-often-neglected-or-mishandled">Interval censoring is often neglected or mishandled</h3>
<p>We found that interval censoring was often neglected or mishandled in the literature. We found that this was often due to a lack of understanding of the difference between single interval censoring and double interval censoring. We also found that many methods that attempted to account for interval censoring did so incorrectly, leading to biased estimates. However, we found that simple approximations, such as assuming a uniform interval of the sum of the primary and secondary events provided an adequate approximation in many cases. We also found that using a latent variable approach, where both the primary and secondary events are modelled as latent variables, provided a robust approach and improved performance. This approacch was also relatively easy to implement.</p>

<p>We identified the method of Ward et al.&nbsp;to be the best performing method. However, this method relies on implicit approximations, which may not hold for more complicated scenarios.</p>
<p>We also introduced and tested two new methods that utilize both incidence time series and delay data. They demonstrated good performance under certain conditions, but they also had inherent limitations depending on the setting.</p>
<p>We find that all methods that we considered had residual biases even when we tried to account for all sources of biases. This is because of a simplifying assumption that the event time is uniformly distributed within the censoring interval. While this is a common assumption, we show that this is generally not true and provide a theoretical framework for dealing with this issue.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-the-limitations-and-future-directions">What are the limitations and future directions?</h2>
<p>All methods we considered here rely on simplifying assumptions. While we lay out mathematical theory for the exact method that does not rely on simplifying assumptions, we did not implement or test this method yet.</p>
<p>We currently lack a statistically sound method that is able to account for temporal changes in continuous-time epidemiological distributions while adjusting for other sources of biases. Specifically, accounting for changes in the forward distribution requires a cohort-based approach based on primary event time. However, the presence of interval censoring in primary event time adds challenges to assigning each individual into cohorts because uncertainty in primary event time need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>There are many other sources of biases that may occur during the data collection or cleaning processes which we did not consider in this study.</p>
<p>We primarily focused on estimating single-individual delays, such as the incubation period or reporting delay. There are additional challenges to estimating transmission intervals that involve more than one person, such as uncertainties in who infected whom. While the methods we considered in this paper can be used to estimate transmission interval distributions, additional attention is needed to consider other sources of biases.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outline">Outline</h2>
<p>As members of the infectious disease modelling community, we recognize the role we play in shaping effective epidemic responses. Our experiences throughout the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted substantial challenges in our field, including psychological pressures, gaps in institutional support, and systemic issues that pervade the academic and research landscape. Motivated by these challenges and committed to improving future response efforts, we, a group of 27 members from the UK infectious disease modelling community, convened for a reflective workshop in March 2023. This summary distils the key issues we identified and proposes strategies that we believe can enhance the effectiveness of our field in future epidemic responses. A full report on our methods and findings, including the anonymised individual feedback from workshop participants that informed our findings, is available.</p>
</section>
<section id="discussion-themes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion-themes">Discussion Themes</h2>
<p>To identify overarching themes, we started with paired discussions, with each participant sharing their personal and professional pandemic experiences for 15 minutes. We then aggregated pairs into groups of increasing size in order to generalise personal experiences into themes. This approach fostered an understanding of the individual experiences that constituted our collective response effort.</p>
<p>Following these discussions, we collectively identified and categorised emergent issues for epidemic response work into themes. These were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Funding and institutional support:</strong> Participants reported insufficient institutional support and contract insecurity due to reliance on external grant funding, impacting both academic and professional services roles. Recognitions, rewards, and access: Current reward metrics were deemed inadequate, with unequal credit attribution and limited access to policy-making spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Team and work dynamics:</strong> Issues included insufficient capacity, competing demands, barriers to progression, and both positive and negative aspects of collaborative working.</li>
<li><strong>Non-academic contributions:</strong> The importance of professional services staff and collaboration with public health agency workers were highlighted.</li>
<li><strong>Personal impacts:</strong> Public recognition led to both increased visibility and challenges; mental ill health and burnout were prevalent; balancing work with personal commitments was difficult for many.</li>
</ul>
<p>We recognise that many of these issues impact those in our field outside of an epidemic response but believe that they are a particular issue for work of this kind. We also acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic has engendered widespread hardship, stress, and ill health throughout various populations, and it is crucial to reflect on and address these profound impacts across all strata of society, not just in our community.</p>
</section>
<section id="priority-recommendations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="priority-recommendations">Priority recommendations</h2>
<p>The workshop proposed the following priority recommendations to improve support and sustainability for future epidemic response work:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Acknowledge and reward impactful response work at institution, funder, and research community levels.</strong> For example, refining impact measures to credit all forms of output produced during, and required for, response work; institutions could incorporate response-driven work into criteria for doctoral theses and promotion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Encourage routine interaction between academia and public health agencies, including consistently reviewing the appropriate allocation of epidemic response tasks.</strong> One potential solution is creating sustainable dual positions recruiting from both sectors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ensure response teams are well-staffed, well-resourced, stable, and provided psychological support.</strong> This approach reduces dependence on key individuals. One approach is to establish sustainable team-building and training programmes during non-response periods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increase the transparency of the evidence pathway from scientists to decision-makers.</strong> This makes it easier for those across the scientific community to contribute as well as making the evidence base for decisions clearer to the general public. This could be achieved by standardising rapid open access to the minutes of scientific advisory meetings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement best practices for a sustainable work environment.</strong> Employers and team leads can promote leave-taking and respecting work hours, clarify communication about processes and rewards across career stages, prepare for, and standardise, the onboarding of new team members, and integrate support roles.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Achieving these changes necessitates investment from governments, funding bodies, and institutions. Teams may need to redefine their working methods to place greater emphasis on well-being, training, and career development. While localised initiatives require time investment from those leading them, they must be supported to foster a healthier and more sustainable environment for future epidemic response work.</p>
<p>As it stands, future epidemic responses are likely to raise similar challenges to those we have identified here, including reliance on a select number of individuals, excessive workloads and the exacerbation of systemic inequalities. It is critical we act outside of response contexts, for example by implementing the recommendations we have outlined, to mitigate these issues and respond more effectively in future.</p>

<section id="strengths-of-these-themes-recommendations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strengths-of-these-themes-recommendations">Strengths of these themes &amp; recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>The insights are deeply rooted in the experiences of the UK modelling community, providing authentic, community-driven perspectives.</li>
<li>The workshop included participants from various career stages and perspectives, bolstering its diversity of views.</li>
<li>An external facilitator and prior community input ensured a safe and relevant discussion environment.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="limitations-of-these-themes-recommendations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations-of-these-themes-recommendations">Limitations of these themes &amp; recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Participant representation was restricted due to the one-day workshop format and limitations on who could attend in person.</li>
<li>Attendees were predominantly from London and South East of England, potentially due to restricted travel support.</li>
<li>Despite efforts, few individuals who left the infectious disease modelling field were present, possibly omitting crucial perspectives.</li>
<li>Consequently, the findings may not fully represent the breadth of experiences, especially the most challenging ones, and could be more moderate than if a wider range of participants attended.</li>
<li>Therefore, these insights should be considered as a summary of a small group’s experiences and opinions, acknowledging potential variations across different locations and groups. Further investigations in other locations are recommended to broaden the scope of findings.</li>

  <title>Lessons learned from collaborative nowcasting of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Germany</title>
  <dc:creator>Johannes Bracher</dc:creator>
  <link>https://epinowcast.org/posts/2023-05-08-collab-nowcasting-covid19-germany/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>This blog post is based on a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.17.23288668v1">preprint</a> we recently posted with a large authorship group. I will summarize my main takeaways from the project. The figures used here are all by <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielWolffram">Daniel Wolffram</a>, the first author of the preprint (and a ggplot wizard). The paper is in turn based on a <a href="https://covid19nowcasthub.de/">collaborative nowcasting platform</a> we have been running since late 2021.</em></p>
<section id="the-indicator-and-the-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-indicator-and-the-challenge">The indicator and the challenge</h2>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, epidemiological indicators have become part of our everyday life. Early on, deaths were the only reliable measure in many places. Then, for a long time, we were staring at case numbers, and later measures of healthcare burden became central. In Germany, where I work, the <strong>7-day COVID-19 hospitalization incidence</strong> became a central indicator in Fall 2021 (with thresholds linked to levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions). However, this indicator has its peculiarities and quickly prompted some public debate (see e.g., this <a href="https://www-ndr-de.translate.goog/nachrichten/info/Fragen-und-Antworten-zur-Hospitalisierungsinzidenz,hospitalisierungsinzidenz102.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">automatic translation</a> of a <a href="https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/Fragen-und-Antworten-zur-Hospitalisierungsinzidenz,hospitalisierungsinzidenz102.html">German-language news item</a>). One difficulty (I’ll gloss over a few <a href="https://covid19nowcasthub.de/background.html">other questions</a>) is its timeliness. The issue arises from its very definition: the 7-day hopitalization incidence is (roughly speaking) the number of people who <em>were reported to have a positive COVID-19 test</em> during said 7-day period and <em>later, and not necessarily during the same 7 days</em>, got admitted to hospital. So hospitalizations are counted by when a positive test rather than when the actual hospitalization was reported. This way, in addition to the classical reporting delay, a second delay is baked into the indicator - the time it takes from a positive test to hospitalization. <strong>As a consequence, it can take a really long time until data are finally complete.</strong> Especially recent values are biased downwards and one can easily get the impression of a downward trend where there isn’t actually one. We therefore figured that <strong>statistical nowcasting</strong> - predicting what the numbers will look like once all data are complete - was a really relevant task here.</p>

<section id="the-collaborative-format" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-collaborative-format">The collaborative format</h2>
<p>If you are in the epidemic modelling sphere, you may have come across the various <strong><a href="https://covid19forecasthub.org/">COVID-19</a> <a href="https://covid19forecasthub.eu/">Forecast</a> <a href="https://kitmetricslab.github.io/forecasthub/forecast">Hubs</a></strong> which bring together epidemiological predictions from various models, systematically compare them and merge them into so-called ensembles. While one conclusion from these efforts is that <a href="https://forecasters.org/blog/2021/09/28/on-the-predictability-of-covid-19/">predicting COVID-19 is really hard</a>, a more positive finding is that combining different models can somewhat enhance performance (see e.g., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2113561119">here</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.81916">here</a>). When the political decision was taken to make the 7-day hospitalization incidence the main pandemic indicator in Germany, we figured it was an interesting setting to <strong>apply this approach to nowcasting</strong>. Specifically, we had two goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>While Robert Koch Institute, the German Federal Public Health Institute, was showing figures of nowcasts in its <a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Wochenbericht/Wochenbericht_2021-11-25.pdf?__blob=publicationFile">weekly reports</a>, no <strong>operational and re-usable nowcasts</strong> were available to be displayed along with real-time data.</li>
<li>When first looking into the problem, we realized that there was a large number of nowcasting methods, but little was known about their actual <strong>real-time behaviour</strong> nor their <strong>relative performance</strong>. Also, nobody had tried to combine several nowcasting models into an <strong>ensemble nowcast</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We therefore reached out to a few people we knew were working on related topics and set up a <a href="https://github.com/KITmetricslab/hospitalization-nowcast-hub/">GitHub repository</a> with pre-processed data as well as a <a href="https://covid19nowcasthub.de/">visualization dashboard</a> to make their contribution as easy as possible. People got on board astonishingly quickly and a few days later we had several nowcasting models up and running, and posted a <a href="https://osf.io/mru75/">study protocol</a> for our methods comparison.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-lessons" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-lessons">The lessons</h2>
<p>If you are interested in the detailed results our <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.17.23288668v1">preprint</a> has you covered. I’ll just say a few words about my main learnings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reassuringly, <strong>all models we considered were doing something reasonable</strong> (see figure), and most of the time they were able to give a realistic idea of current trends. Every now and then, nowcasts were also considerably off. Typically, that happened when reporting practices changed, and most models were affected in a similar manner.</li>
<li>One of the main challenges was to get <strong>weekday effects</strong> under control (there are two of them - one for the date of positive test, one for the date of hospitalization). Our purposefully simple “reference model” KIT does not take this aspect into account and consequently looks like an ill-calibrated cardiogram.</li>
</ul>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://epinowcast.org/posts/2023-05-08-collab-nowcasting-covid19-germany/zero_day.png" title="For different models, the figure shows an overlay of 'final' data and nowcasts as issued on each day for the same day, i.e., at a horizon of 0 days back. Point nowcasts overall align well with later completed data, but uncertainty intervals are a bit too narrow for most models and do not always cover the corrected values." class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Same-day nowcasts (with a horizon of 0 days) of the 7-day hospitalization incidence as issued on each day of the study period. Nowcasts are shown for the German national level pooled across all age groups.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uncertainty quantification turned out to be tricky</strong>. Almost none of the models issued prediction intervals reaching nominal coverage levels. One important learning was that purely model-based uncertainty quantification (like your model’s predictive posterior distribution) does not work all that well in practice. Two approaches which looked at errors of past nowcasts fared much better (sort of poor man’s versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_prediction">conformal prediction</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Defining a nowcasting target is not as trivial as it seems.</strong> We somewhat naively defined it as “the final version of the time series”, which in practice we assumed would be available 100 days after the last day for which we generated nowcasts. However, it turned out that the data were still changing after these 100 days. Only slightly, but enough to have an impact on results. Looking back, rather than using the data version available on a specified date, a better idea might have been to define the target as all hospitalizations reported with a maximum delay of, say, 40 days.</li>
<li>As in similar previous projects, <strong>combined emsemble predictions</strong> showed promising results. On our pre-specified original target, they actually came in second and were beaten quite clearly by one of the individual models. That, however, seemed to be due to a peculiar overlay of a few different biases working in different directions (it’s a long discussion, check out the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.17.23288668v1">paper</a>). Personally I am optimistic that across different settings there is something to be gained from ensemble nowcasts.</li>

<p>Given the sudden prominence of the 7-day hospitalization incidence in the management of the pandemic in Germany, in fall and winter 2021 there was considerable interest in the nowcasts we made available. Many media outlets are now winding down their <strong>COVID dashboards</strong>, but e.g., at newspaper <a href="https://www.zeit.de/wissen/aktuelle-corona-zahlen-karte-deutschland-landkreise">Die Zeit</a> and public broadcaster <a href="https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/Corona-Zahlen-Arztbesuche-Hospitalisierung-Todesfaelle,corona10702.html">NDR</a>, the nowcasts are still routinely displayed in May 2023. Following some very productive exchange with colleagues from Robert Koch Institute, our platform has also been referred to in their <a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Wochenbericht/Wochenbericht_2023-05-04.pdf?__blob=publicationFile">weekly reports</a> (accompanying their own nowcasts).</p>
<p>An interesting aspect in the exchange with data journalists was that they were sort of <strong>hesitant to use the ensemble nowcast</strong>. After all, it was based on a difficult-to-understand mix of methods, some of which not yet formally peer-reviewed. Understandably, for them it made sense to have one specific method to point to, published in a journal of known reputation. A positive experience was that at least some media outlets took care to <strong>communicate the uncertainty</strong> associated with nowcasts explicitly.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-aftermath">The aftermath</h2>
<p>Our multi-model nowcasting system is still up and running. As it requires close to no human intervention at this stage (apart from fixing occasional data hiccups), we will likely maintain it until the data source is wound down. There are also a few <strong>follow up projects</strong>, like the <a href="https://respinow.de/en/projects/#tp4">RESPINOW project</a> on other relevant respiratory pathogens, and the <a href="https://www.epinowcast.org/">epinowcast</a> community on real-time analysis of infectious disease data (if you are reading this blog post, you likely already know epinowcast, but it’s great and you should definitely check out the ways of <a href="https://www.epinowcast.org/contribute.html">getting involved</a>).</p>
<p>To conclude I’ll mention that I am currettly <a href="https://www.pse.kit.edu/english/karriere/joboffer.php?id=132323"><strong>hiring for a Research Associate / PhD student position</strong></a> (also check this <a href="https://twitter.com/johannesbracher/status/1650483102634975232">thread</a> on Twitter). Please reach out to me if you are interested in real-time analysis of epidemiological data!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In this release, we focused on improving the internal code structure, documentation, and development infrastructure of the package to make it easier to maintain and extend functionality in the future. We also fixed a number of bugs and made some minor improvements to the interface. These changes included extending test and documentation coverage across all package functions, improving internal data checking and internalization, and removing some deprecated functions.</p>
<p>While these changes are not expected to impact most users, we recommend that all users upgrade to this version. We also suggest that users who have fitted models with both random effects and random walks should refit these models and compare the output to previous fits in order to understand the impact of a bug in the specification of these models that was fixed in this release.</p>
<p>This release lays the groundwork for planned features in <a href="https://github.com/orgs/epinowcast/projects/1"><code>0.3.0</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/orgs/epinowcast/projects/2"><code>0.4.0</code></a> including: support for non-parametric delays, non-daily data with a non-daily process model (i.e.&nbsp;weekly data with a weekly process model), additional flexibility specifying generation times and latent reporting delays, improved case studies, and adding support for forecasting.</p>
<p>Full details on the changes in this release can be found in the <a href="https://package.epinowcast.org/news/index.html">package release notes</a> or in the <a href="https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/releases/tag/v0.2.1">GitHub release notes</a>. To see the development timeline of this release see the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/epinowcast/projects/3"><code>0.2.1</code> project</a>.</p>
