On Wednesday the 7th of June at 2pm UK time Katelyn Gostic will be introducing the new US CDC [Centre for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics (CFA)](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html). *More details to follow*

Katelyn is the nowcasting and natural history team lead within the real-time analysis branch of the Predict arm of the new CFA centre. Prio to this they had a McDonnell Foundation Complex Systems Fellowship in the [Cobey lab](https://cobeylab.uchicago.edu/people/katie-gostic/) researching immune processes that allow such biases in immune memory to develop. They also took part in the US COVID-19 response including writing an influential paper ["Practical considerations for measuring the effective reproductive number"](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008409).

A recording of this talk will be posted to [our community site](https://community.epinowcast.org/c/meetings/8) a week after it is scheduled to take place. You can also ask questions ahead of time and asynchronously there.
