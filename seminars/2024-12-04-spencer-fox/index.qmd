On Wednesday the 8th of January at 3pm UK time, Dr Spencer Fox will discuss ensemble models for infectious diseases and microHubs.

On the basis of historical influenza and COVID-19 forecasts, we found that more than 3 forecast models are needed to ensure robust ensemble accuracy. Additional models can improve ensemble performance, but with diminishing accuracy returns. This understanding will assist with the design of current and future collaborative infectious disease forecasting efforts. Building on this work, we are pioneering the use of “microHubs” that mimic larger collaborative forecast hubs using a minimal subset of robust forecasting models, dramatically lowering the required resources for forecasting and allowing for organizations to mirror hubs using privately held data. I will discuss our pilot project from the past year for influenza, COVID-19, and RSV healthcare forecasts for the Paraguay Ministerio de Salud Pública y Bienestar Social in collaboration with the CDC, Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the Pan American Health Organization.

Spencer J. Fox is an Assistant Professor in the department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and the Institute of Bioinformatics at the University of Georgia. Spencer obtained a BSc in Biology from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and a PhD from the Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior program at The University of Texas at Austin. His research focuses on integrating biological, epidemiological, and statistical models to understand and predict outbreak dynamics. Prior to joining the University of Georgia he was the Associate Director of the UT COVID-19 Modeling Consortium.
